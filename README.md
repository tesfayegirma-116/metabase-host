## Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Copy the Example Environment File**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. **Start Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

### Notes
- Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
- The `-d` flag runs your containers in detached mode, allowing them to run in the background.
